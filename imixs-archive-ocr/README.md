# imixs-archive OCR

Imixs-Archive-OCR is a sub project of Imixs-Archive providing a solution for OCR scans on documents. 


The project provides a shell script to perform a OCR scan on documents managed by the system.  
This script is based on the tesseract library. The script automatically converts PDF files into a TIF format, so this 
script can be used for images as also for PDF files.  The text result is stored into a file ${FILENAME}.txt
